Pam’s insatiable desire for human relationships has also paired well with her music craft. She has trained both young and old in the vocal arts with intense emphasis on gospel and jazz stylings. Music also takes her around the block and world as she sings and participates in music presentations of all kinds. If you can’t find Pam with her hubby and best friend Michael, look in her flower garden. If she isn’t there, look in her music studio or the local movie theater. Not there either?
