          <p class="fs-xl mb-lg-4">Do It Greener Foundation was the brainchild of Yvette Brown and her daughter, Ayden.  For several years, Yvette and Ayden researched how making small and simple changes can make a positive impact on our environment. The smartest way to ensure that this happens is to get the community to work together as a team.  As a result, Yvette and Ayden decided to found DIG as a nonprofit organization dedicated to making our community, our state, our country, as well as our world, more eco-friendly.
              The Do It Greener (DIG) Foundation was established in 2020 as a 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to sustainably enhancing quality of life and education technology opportunities. DIG’s organizational structure ensures its objectives are comprehensive in scope and inherently inclusive by maintaining a diverse board of professionals from key areas of insight.

           <p class="fs-xl mb-lg-4">
              We truly believe that as a community striving for sustainability, innovation, and inclusivity, we can all do things a little “greener.”</p>
